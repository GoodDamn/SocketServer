Supports requests/responses with: 
* HTTP
* Share protocol (Developed for the app)
* SMTP Support
* SSH simulation (Runtime class doesn't work because Android security)

P.S. For SSH exists some self methods which simulates, like you write to console and execute it

* mdk 'folder name' - makes a dir in user's directory

Future ideas:
* SSL TCP
* VPN simulation
